                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Star Wars is the science fiction odyssey that has 
                        taken the mainstream audiences by storm</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, many older fans fervently claim that only the original 
                    trilogy is worth watching and they actively campaign against the newer iterations. 
                    Conversely, more reasonable fans and new comers a like are just happy to see the 
                    Star Wars universe continue to expand with the addition of new content</p>   
                    
                    <p>Since the order of the films can be confusing to new comers this page can be
                        used as a reference to help you understand the sequence of events within the
                        canonical story line.</p>

                                turned into the infamous Darth Vader. This film begins by introducing us to a new Jedi Qui

                            <p>The epic second instalment of the second trilogy takes us further into the turmoil
                                that is unfolding within the galactic republic. Anakin Skywalker has grown into a 
                                young adult. Although he is now strong with the force, he is quick tempered, and 
                                we begin to see more hits of his fall toward the dark side of the force. This film
                                also introduces us to Jango Fett, the father of Bubba Fett. Jango is also the DNA 
                                sample that is utilized to build the clone army. As the film unfolds we see the evil 
                                machinations of the Sith build toward all-out war that will further weaken the Jedi 
                                and the democracy of the galactic republic.</p>

                            <p>This is the climatic conclusion to the prequel trilogy. In this film we see the 
                                final steps that Anakin Skywalker takes to become the infamous Darth Vader. In many ways
                                 his life is a tragedy and the film does a great job of showing how small pushes and the 
                                 right amount of negative influence helped to push this young Jedi to the dark side of 
                                 the force. All the subversive machinations of the Sith come to a head and the Oppressive
                                  empire emerges to begin its tyrannical reign. </p>

                            <h4>Film Overview</h4>
                            <p>This film marks the beginning of the departure from the trilogy structure. The main trilogy 
                                continues to be developed but there will now also be standalone stories that focus on 
                                different areas of the Star Wars story. Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars films that
                                 have been made and is one my favorites. One of the key factors that makes this film so 
                                 memorable is the fact that they incorporated characters and scenes form the original
                                  film. This film takes place directly before the beginning of ep4. The last scene of 
                                  this film ends exactly where the next film opens. Also, if you watch the pilot scenes 
                                  carefully you will notice that they cut clips form the episode 4 in order to insert 
                                  these charters into this story since they would have been alive at that time. This 
                                  film is packed full of the nostalgia factor for long-time fans but also is a well-made
                                   film for new comers alike. </p>

                                The parentage of Rey still remains a mystery, but we see Kylo ren begin to grow further
