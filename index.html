            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Star Wars is the science fiction odyssey that has 
                taken the mainstream audiences by storm</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, many older fans fervently claim that only the original 
            trilogy is worth watching and they actively campaign against the newer iterations. 
            Conversely, more reasonable fans and new comers a like are just happy to see the 
            Star Wars universe continue to expand with the addition of new content</p>   
            
            <p>Since the order of the films can be confusing to new comers this page can be
                used as a reference to help you understand the sequence of events within the
                canonical story line.</p>

            <p>Please review the summaries below. All items in the section below are listed in order 
                of release date.</p>
