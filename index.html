                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Star Wars is the science fiction odyssey that has 
                        taken the mainstream audiences by storm</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, many older fans fervently claim that only the original 
                    trilogy is worth watching and they actively campaign against the newer iterations. 
                    Conversely, more reasonable fans and new comers a like are just happy to see the 
                    Star Wars universe continue to expand with the addition of new content</p>   
                    
                    <p>Since the order of the films can be confusing to new comers this page can be
                        used as a reference to help you understand the sequence of events within the
                        canonical story line.</p>

                            <h4>Film Overview</h4>
                            <p>The epic second instalment of the second trilogy takes us further into the turmoil
                                that is unfolding within the galactic republic. Anakin Skywalker has grown into a 
                                young adult. Although he is now strong with the force, he is quick tempered, and 
                                we begin to see more hits of his fall toward the dark side of the force. This film
                                also introduces us to Jango Fett, the father of Bubba Fett. Jango is also the DNA 
                                sample that is utilized to build the clone army. As the film unfolds we see the evil 
                                machinations of the Sith build toward all-out war that will further weaken the Jedi 
                                and the democracy of the galactic republic.</p>
