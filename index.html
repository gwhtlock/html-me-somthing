        <p>Star Wars is the science fiction odyssey that has 
            taken the mainstream audiences by storm</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, many older fans fervently claim that only the original 
        trilogy is worth watching and they actively campaign against the newer iterations. 
        Conversely, more reasonable fans and new comers a like are just happy to see the 
        Star Wars universe continue to expand with the addition of new content</p>   
        
        <p>Since the order of the films can be confusing to new comers this page can be
             used as a reference to help you understand the sequence of events within the
              canonical story line.</p>
